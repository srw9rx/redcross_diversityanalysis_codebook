# redcross_diversityanalysis_codebook
This repository contains all of the source code used for the American Red Cross of Central Virginia's diversity project. This repository contains a combination of Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3) and R code. We used these to perform a variety of different tests on the data we collected.

You can see our final, written report for the results of our work. This code is meant to be supplementary to that report and provide a guidebook for using this study in other areas.
